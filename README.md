### 👨‍💻 About Me

Hey there! I'm Pratham V K, a graduate student at Arizona State University (📍Tempe, AZ) pursuing a Master’s in Robotics and Autonomous Systems. I enjoy solving real-world problems with deep learning, NLP, and backend systems. Previously, I worked at Ness Digital Engineering where I helped build financial tools and performance-optimized APIs, and developed browser extensions that improved everyday user tasks.
