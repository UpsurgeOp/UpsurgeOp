### 👨‍💻 About Me

Hey there! I'm Pratham V K, a graduate student at Arizona State University (📍Tempe, AZ) pursuing a Master’s in Robotics and Autonomous Systems. I enjoy solving real-world problems with deep learning, NLP, and backend systems. Before grad school, I worked on building scalable financial systems at Ness Digital Engineering and developing tools that make life easier—like browser extensions and analytics dashboards.

### 💼 Professional Experience

🧩 **Software Engineer Intern – Ness Digital Engineering**  
📍Bengaluru, India | 🗓️ Feb 2023 – Aug 2023  

At Ness, I contributed to a large-scale banking application focused on backend performance and data pipeline reliability. Some of the key things I worked on:

- 🔄 Developed scalable APIs with structured logging and transaction-level analytics, improving backend performance by 30%.
- 🔐 Built secure RESTful services on AWS (EC2, S3) with JWT authentication for safe and efficient financial data processing.
- 🧪 Validated APIs using Postman and Swagger across dev, staging, and pre-prod environments.
- 🌐 Built a React-based browser extension (using TypeScript + Node.js) to decode and manage URLs more efficiently—cutting processing time by 60% and boosting parsing accuracy to 95%.

### 🔧 What I’ve Been Building

Here are a few cool projects I’ve worked on recently:

🛡️ **BullyScan - Real-Time Cyberbullying Detection**  
A real-time tweet classification tool built using DistilBERT + Tweepy. It detects six types of cyberbullying with 82.3% accuracy and F1-scores above 0.95.  
→ Built with: PyTorch, Transformers, Twitter API  
→ Real-world use case: Moderation assistant for social media platforms.

📈 **Stock Market Data Explorer & Risk Analyzer**  
An interactive Streamlit tool for analyzing stock trends and portfolio risk. Integrated Apache Spark + SQL pipelines and Tableau dashboards.  
→ Built with: Streamlit, yFinance, Apache Spark, SQL, Tableau  
→ Designed for investors and analysts to make smarter decisions.

⚡ **Energy Price Forecasting (ARIMA + LSTM)**  
Forecasted hourly electricity prices using hybrid time series models—ARIMA for trend and LSTM for sequence learning. Achieved 92% directional accuracy.  
→ Built with: LSTM, ARIMA, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib


🌐 **Browser Extension for Link Management**  
A React + TypeScript browser extension that improved link parsing accuracy to 95% and reduced URL decoding time by 60%.  
→ Built with: React, TypeScript, Node.js
